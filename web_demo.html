        Savva Savelev
         signs off when he writes code. He is currently finishing his final year of a levels and to further develop
         his knowledge and understanding in computer science, he has begun desiging his own website to demonstrate his coding skills

            - savva has done a coding project as part of his a level course, to design a poker game, he coded his graphics in a language called GUIZERO. 
                It is a relatively simple and straight forward language for graphic design that can be particularly beneficial for beginners.

         </li><li> This school is run by Rick Faye, certified under Dan Inosanto,
        who was a student of Bruce Lee. Lee's personal art of Jeet Kune Do
        pioneered the formerly heretical concept of combining the best aspects
        of several martial arts traditions. I'm studying a mixture of
        Kali/Silat, Filipino and Indonesian weapons-based arts; Muay Thai,
        aka Thai boxing, a kickboxing art; Wing Chun, a style of Chinese gong
        fu (popularly known as kung fu); Shoot Wrestling, a ground-based
        Japanese grappling art; and Savate, a French kickboxing style. Rick is
        one of the greatest teachers I've ever met, and kickboxing is
        completely addictive...
